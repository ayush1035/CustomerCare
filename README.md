# CustomerCare

This project is a website showing customers data. The main motive of this project is to show the layered structure of the code used to
fetch customer data from the database and show it on the website. The singleton pattern is also followed.

The languages used in this project are Angular2 for front end, Node.js for the backend and the database used is MySQL.The services in Angular 2 are used to make a call to a url, which is handled by Node.js helping to fetch the data from MySQL database. 

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.4.4.
